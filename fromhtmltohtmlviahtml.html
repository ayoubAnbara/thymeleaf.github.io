    <h1>From HTML to HTML (via HTML)</h1>

    <p>
      Knowing the internals of the HTML family of web standards is quite important 
      when you are using software such as Thymeleaf. At least if you want to understand
      what you are doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem is that many people know the technologies they are
      using for creating webs, but don't really know where these technologies
      come from. It has been a long way since the inception of the first web
      interfaces, and since then every new technology has been changing the way
      we developed for the web by deprecating a good amount of our work and,
      especially, our knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, with the arrival of HTML5, things have become even more complicated.
      <em>What's it?</em> <em>Why is it HTML instead of XHTML?</em> <em>Wasn't the 
      HTML tag soup considered harmful?</em>  
    </p>
    <p>
      So let's take a step back, and see how we arrived where we are now, and why.
    </p>

    <h2>Back in the 90s, there was HTML...</h2>

    <p>
      ...and HTML was a standard (or more correctly, a
      <em>recommendation</em>) maintained by the <em>World Wide Web Consortium</em>
      (a.k.a. W3C). Extending from a language called SGML, HTML defined a
      tag-based markup language for writing rich hyper-text documents,
      highly coupled to the protocol that was used for serving them and
      their related resources across the network: the <em>Hyper-Text
      Transfer Protocol</em> (HTTP).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTTP used text <em>headers</em> for defining what
      was being served to clients and how, one of which was extremely
      important: the <kbd>Content-Type</kbd>
      header. This header explained to browsers what type of content was
      being served to them in a language called <em>MIME (Multipurpose
      Internet Mail Extensions)</em>. And the MIME type used for serving
      HTML documents was <kbd>text/html</kbd>:
    </p>
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush:plain;gutter:false"><![CDATA[
        Content-Type: text/html
    ]]></script>
    <p>
      HTML also defined a way to check whether a
      document was <em>valid</em>. Being valid basically meant that the
      document was written according to the HTML rules that dictated what
      attributes a tag could have, where a tag could appear in the
      document, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      These validity rules were specified using a
      language for defining the structure of SGML documents called <em>Document
      Type Definition</em> or DTD. A Standard DTD was created for each
      version of HTML, and HTML documents had to declare the DTD (and
      therefore the version of HTML) they conformed to by means of a clause
      that should appear as their first line, the <em>Document Type
      Declaration</em> or <kbd>DOCTYPE</kbd> clause:
    </p>
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush:html;gutter:false"><![CDATA[
        <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
    ]]></script>

    <h2>The Document Object Model and the tag soup</h2>
   
    <p>
      HTML was meant for displaying documents in
      browsers, and back in the late 90s browsers were made by fiercely
      competing companies that wanted to offer the maximum amount of cool
      features to their users. Given that HTML only defined rules for
      document formatting, many other features were left to the browser
      developers' imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      And one of the most interesting ideas that
      appeared in browsers was <em>client-side interactivity</em>. This
      interactivity was achieved by executing <em>scripts</em> &mdash; in
      languages such as JavaScript &mdash; inside the browser itself, and
      giving these scripts the ability to handle, modify and even execute
      events on parts of the document being displayed. For this, browsers
      had to model HTML documents as in-memory trees of objects, each of
      them with state and events, and thus the <em>Document Object Model</em>
      (DOM) was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem was that HTML rules for
      well-formedness were quite loose whereas DOM trees were strictly
      hierarchical structures, and this meant that different
      interpretations of HTML tag positions and sequences could lead to
      different DOM object trees in different browsers. Add to this the
      fact that these different browsers modelled the API of DOM nodes in
      different ways (different names, events, etc) and you will start to
      get the idea of how difficult it was to create cross-browser
      interactivity back then.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's more: while all this was happening,
      browsers had been growing quite forgiving with HTML authors, allowing
      them to write HTML documents that were not well formed (<em>tag soups</em>)
      by automagically correcting their errors. This lead HTML authors to
      create even worse formed documents, and then browsers to allow even
      more errors in format, adding to a quite destructive cycle. And guess
      what: each browser was correcting all these errors in a different
      way. Hooray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The W3C finally standardized the DOM API and a
      language for scripting in web browsers: JavaScript (although for some
      complex reasons they insisted on calling it ECMAScript). But the
      damage done by the world of tag soups coupled with the slow adoption
      of these standards in full by browser makers &mdash; in many cases
      fearing they would damage backwards compatibility &mdash; produced
      effects that are still influencing the way we create web applications
      today.
    </p>

    <h2>Enter XML</h2>

    <p>
      Some time after HTML became a widely spread
      language, the W3C developed a new specification called XML
      (<em>eXtensible Markup Language</em>), aimed at the representation of
      general-purpose data (not only web) in the form of hierarchical
      markup text.
    </p>
    <p>
      XML was extensible in that it allowed the
      definition of purpose-specific languages (tags and their attributes)
      to fit the needs of specific scenarios. But HTML documents were not
      well formed from the XML perspective, XML and HTML remained in fact
      incompatible languages. It was not possible to express HTML as an XML
      <em>application</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being strictly hierarchical and removing the
      structural ambiguities of HTML, XML documents were more directly
      translatable to standardized DOM trees (a process known as <em>XML
      Parsing</em>). Also given the fact that XML was a text-based language,
      and that text is a sort of technology-agnostic format (as opposed to
      binary), XML became especially suited for the cross-platform
      interchange of data across the internet. In fact, it led to the birth
      of the now-ubiquitous <em>Web Services</em> technologies.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML + XML = XHTML</h2>

    <p>
      At some point, driven by the obvious usefulness of
      XML and the fact that it could make web documents more extensible and
      interoperable (like, for example, producing more predictable DOMs
      across browsers), the W3C decided to reformulate HTML as an XML
      dialect (or <em>application</em>) instead of an SGML one, and so XHTML
      was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      XHTML required web authors to write their
      documents as well-formed XML, which introduced some formatting rules
      that didn't exist in HTML before: tags should always be closed,
      attributes should always be escaped and surrounded by quotes, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The introduction of XHTML and the transformation
      of web documents into well formed XML was generally perceived as a
      step forward, because it would allow higher levels of standardization
      across browsers, less space for authoring errors that had to be
      corrected in browser-specific ways, and easier parsing and automated
      processing of web pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a part of this, XHTML introduced a
      controversial concept coming directly from XML and known as <em>Draconian
      Error Handling</em>, which meant that any interpreter of XML &mdash;
      including now a browser &mdash; should fail immediately should any
      kind of format error be found in the XML document being processed. In
      practice, this meant that XHTML authors would have to create
      perfectly well-formed documents or accept the fact that browsers
      would never be able (in fact, allowed) to display them at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      For validation, the XHTML 1.0 specification
      defined a set of DTDs that could be used in <kbd>DOCTYPE</kbd>
      clauses: <kbd>XHTML 1.0 Strict</kbd>,
      <kbd>XHTML 1.0 Transitional</kbd>
      and <kbd>XHTML 1.0 Frameset</kbd>.
      The first one was meant for <em>pure</em> XHTML documents that didn't
      use any deprecated tags coming from HTML, the second one for
      transitional documents that still made use of deprecated tags and
      attributes, and the third one for frameset pages.
    </p>
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush:html;gutter:false"><![CDATA[
        <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
    ]]></script>
    <p>
      But one of the most important aspects of XHTML was
      that it also introduced a new MIME type, which was the one that every
      web server was supposed to use for serving XHTML so that  browsers
      knew that they had to use their XHTML parser and engine instead of
      their HTML equivalents. This was <kbd>application/xhtml+xml</kbd>:
    </p>
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush:plain;gutter:false"><![CDATA[
        Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml
    ]]></script>
    
    <h2>Crashing down to (XHTML's) reality</h2>

    <p>
      Just after its introduction, everything looked
      bright for XHTML. We developers should just have to wait for browsers
      to fully implement it and the world of web development would suddenly
      look much happier...
    </p>
    <p>
      Trouble is, that never happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened was that one specific browser simply
      denied implementing support for the <kbd>application/xhtml+xml</kbd>
      content type. Guess which one. Yeah, exactly, that one. Internet
      Explorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      IE6, IE7 and IE8 show a download dialog when you
      try to access a document served with XHTML's own content type, and
      that of course means that you cannot use that content type if you
      want to be able to display your web site to IE users. IE9 seems to be
      on the way to correct that, but it is simply too late by now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately &mdash; or maybe unfortunately &mdash;
      The XHTML 1.0 specification included an appendix that stated that
      XHTML 1.0 content could also be served using the old <kbd>text/html</kbd>
      content type from the HTML times, in order to ease the transition.
      And that's exactly what most of us have been doing the past several
      years: creating XHTML 1.0 content, and then serving it as <kbd>text/html</kbd>.
      Given that the XHTML 1.0 specification was published in 2000, the
      <em>transition</em> has taken long.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fact is that when you serve content as
      HTML instead of XHTML browsers will use their HTML engines for it,
      and not the XHTML-specific ones. And although their HTML engines have
      been XHTML-enabled, they still have to provide backwards
      compatibility for old HTML 4 code &mdash; which makes them very
      tricky pieces of software &mdash; and importantly, they lack some of
      the most XML-ish features of XHTML, starting with... Draconian Error
      Handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you don't have Draconian Error Handling,
      you have a forgiving engine that will let you serve documents that
      are not well formed, automagically correcting your errors. And if you
      know the browser will correct your errors (in a browser-specific
      way), you will probably never correct your documents... and so the
      HTML horror story still goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing this, think that you've probably never
      really created a truly XHTML web site. What you've done is (probably
      ill-formed) XHTML documents served and displayed as plain old HTML.
      How about that?
    </p>
    <p>
      But it went worse, because in 2002 <kbd>XHTML
      1.1</kbd> removed the possibility of using the HTML content type,
      therefore allowing only <kbd>application/xhtml+xml</kbd>.
      The problem was that, instead of this forcing Internet Explorer to
      support <kbd>application/xhtml+xml</kbd>,
      which didn't happen, this restriction simply turned XHTML 1.1 into as
      much a mythological creature as Nessie. Almost no one ever used it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2009, the W3C allowed again the use of
      <kbd>text/html</kbd> with XHTML
      1.1 but, again, it was too late.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Towards HTML5: A divorce story</h2>
    
    <p>
      At some point (specifically, 2004), some browser
      makers realised that the existing XHTML specifications were evolving
      too slowly to cope with the increasing demands of the web (video,
      audio, richer application interfaces...), and that the W3C was
      increasingly pushing them towards creating stricter interpretations
      of documents that could end up rendering huge amounts of (ill-formed)
      existing code useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      They wanted to enhance web applications with
      capabilities like video, audio, local storage, or advanced form
      processing, and in fact they could do it by just adding those
      features in a browser-specific way, but they didn't want to go the
      non-interoperable way again. They needed the standards to evolve and
      include these new features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, there was a problem with evolving
      the existing standards of the time (namely XHTML): there were still
      lots and lots of web sites and applications still relying on legacy
      HTML out there, and if those cool new features were standardized by
      going the XHTML ultra-strict way, all those applications would never
      be able to use the new features unless they were completely
      rewritten. And everybody wanted a more interoperable and standard
      web, but not at the cost of throwing away many years of work done by
      millions of web authors.
    </p>
    <p>
      So these makers (along with other individuals)
      presented the W3C with the idea of evolving HTML in a way that made
      all (or most) existing HTML and XHTML code still valid as <em>new
      HTML</em> while providing powerful new features for web
      applications and &mdash; importantly &mdash; clearly defining the way
      in which error handling should be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter point meant that instead of failing on
      the first error, browsers would know <em>by specification</em> how to
      perform the automagical correction of errors created by web authors
      and therefore would react to them in exactly the same way,
      effectively turning HTML code (be it XML-formed or not) fully
      cross-browser. You would still be recommended to create XML-formed
      code for new sites, but if you didn't fancy or you still had some
      tons of old legacy HTML (and most certainly you had), you would still
      be invited to join the party. See that old HTML site there? Let's add
      some video to it! It all sounded quite sensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fact is, all of this didn't sound quite as
      well to W3C back in 2004, and they rejected the proposal and decided
      to go strictly the XHTML way. HTML was dead for them, there was no
      reason to resurrect it, and <kbd>XHTML
      2.0</kbd> was the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led to divorce. The proponents of this new
      concept for HTML, a group that included individuals from Opera
      Software, the Mozilla Foundation and Apple, left the W3C and founded
      the <em>Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)</em>
      with the aim of defining what we today know as HTML5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in 2007, the W3C created a working group
      for <em>next-generation HTML</em>, which later accepted to join efforts
      with WHATWG, effectively adopting HTML5 as their working
      specification and future deliverable. W3C and WHATWG were now united
      for creating HTML5, and in 2009 the W3C just let XHTML 2.0 die by
      closing the group working on its specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML5 was now the <em>only</em> future of web
      standards.
    </p>
    
    <h2>So what is HTML5?</h2>
    
    <p>
      HTML5 is a set of standards &mdash; still under
      development as of 2011 &mdash; evolving from current HTML 4 and XHTML
      specifications and aimed at:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Adding advanced new capabilities to HTML that
        effectively move web development slightly away from the
        document-oriented philosophy and towards a more application-oriented
        one. Such capabilities are called <em>HTML5 features</em> and are in
        some cases defined by standards on their own, apart from the HTML5
        core one. HTML5 features include, among others: video, audio,
        drawing canvas, geolocation, local storage, offline support and
        advanced form-related capabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Providing a pain-free path for migration from
        HTML and XHTML, which enables the adoption of HTML5 with little or
        no rewriting of code at all.
      </li>
      <li>
        Providing a standard way of handling code
        errors, so that ill-formed HTML5 code will perform in the same
        predictable way in all browsers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      From a practical point of view, this means that
      (probably all of) your current HTML and XHTML code will be considered
      valid HTML5 just by changing your <kbd>DOCTYPE</kbd>
      to the HTML5 one:
    </p>
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush:html;gutter:false"><![CDATA[
        <!DOCTYPE html>
    ]]></script>
    <p>
      And by serving your content with content type
      <kbd>text/html</kbd>:
    </p>
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush:plain;gutter:false"><![CDATA[
        Content-Type: text/html
    ]]></script>
    <p>
      And here you might be thinking: why does that
      <kbd>DOCTYPE</kbd> specify no
      DTD at all? Because there isn't one. HTML5 has no DTD because the
      rules that define whether a document is valid HTML5 or not are
      defined as human-readable text in the specification itself, but
      cannot be expressed in the DTD language.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this does not mean that an HTML5 parser and/or
      engine cannot validate. It can. It simply has to be a piece of
      software especially devoted to HTML5 parsing including specific code
      programmed for executing the rules that are involved in validating
      HTML5 (as opposed to reading those rules from a DTD file). Even if
      the specification is now quite flexible, it still <em>is</em> a
      specification, and you have to conform to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if there is no DTD, then why have a DOCTYPE
      clause at all? Because a DOCTYPE clause is needed in order to make
      browsers display documents in <em>Standards Mode</em> (as opposed to
      <em>Quirks Mode</em>). The clause <kbd>&lt;!DOCTYPE
      html&gt;</kbd> is the minimum valid DOCTYPE declaration possible,
      and that is exactly all we need. It just acts as a switch.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Can I use HTML5 already?</h2>
    
    <p>
      Yes and no. You can use some of the HTML5 features
      that have already been implemented into some browsers, but (as of
      2011) there still is no browser that fully implements all of the
      HTML5 features. And even if there was, that could change because the
      specification itself is still work in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using HTML5 in full will in fact take some time,
      to be honest. Think that not only you will have to wait for some
      browser to implement all of HTML5, but that in fact you will have to
      wait for <em>most</em> browsers to do it, and then wait for your
      potential users to upgrade their browsers to these versions. Now
      think that a noticeable percent of big companies still use Internet
      Explorer 6 (published in 2001) as their standard browser and...
      well... cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But anyway, one thing is for sure: you can switch
      your DOCTYPE to HTML5's and you will be doing HTML5. And that is
      something you can do today if you feel the need to.
    </p>
    
    <h2>And what about XHTML5? Does that exist?</h2>
    
    <p>
      In theory, yes. XHTML5 is just HTML5 served with:
    </p>
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush:plain;gutter:false"><![CDATA[
        Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml
    ]]></script>
    <p>
      But again, this content type is not currently
      supported by IE. So in practice, no, it doesn't exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be careful though: the difference between HTML5
      and XHTML5 is the content type and <em>only</em> the content type,
      because an XML-formed HTML5 document is in fact a perfectly valid
      HTML5 document. This is quite different to the relation between HTML4
      and XHTML 1.0/1.1, which were incompatible languages.
    </p>
    
    <h2>OK. The history lesson was great. Now, how does this relate to Thymeleaf?</h2>
    
    <p>
      Out-of-the-box (it is extensible), Thymeleaf allows you to create web templates according
      to three specifications:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>XHTML 1.0 (Strict, Transitional and Frameset)</li>
      <li>XHTML 1.1</li>
      <li>HTML5</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Support for HTML5 has a tricky part, though: Thymeleaf
      will make you decide whether your HTML5 templates are XML-formed code
      or not, and strongly suggest you that they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main reason for this is that at the heart of the default configuration of
      Thymeleaf lie an XML parser and a DOM processor, and so Thymeleaf will always
      need XML input. If your HTML5 templates are well-formed XML they will
      be parsed just as fine as any other XHTML template; but if they
      aren't, Thymeleaf will need to execute a previous conversion (basically a
      tag balancing operation) to convert your HTML into XML before parsing.
      Obviously, this will not be the end of the world, but in some
      high-load scenarios it could affect template processing performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, truth be told, that should not happen very
      often. The main reason HTML5 allows non-XML syntax is legacy
      integration, and there is no good reason why you should not be
      closing your tags and escaping your attributes in new applications
      being developed these days, voluntarily making them difficult to parse
      and work with (unless you are Google and transferring the extra bytes 
      in attribute values over the net would <i>really</i> make a difference to you). 
      Remember that <em>with power comes
      responsibility</em>. You do not want to voluntarily go back to
      the olden days of tag soup by relying on how well browsers implement
      standardized error handling, do you?
