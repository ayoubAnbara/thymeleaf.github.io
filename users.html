                          <strong>Broadleaf</strong> is an open source, enterprise-ready eCommerce solution developed using the widely
                          adopted Spring Framework. We built our 2.0 demo site in <strong>Thymeleaf</strong>.

                      <p>
                          After an overwhelmingly positive building experience, picking a templating language for our
                          admin tool when we were replatforming was obvious. We currently leverage <strong>Thymeleaf</strong> for both
                          our 3.0 demo site and internal admin tool.

                      <p>
                          The flexibility and extension hooks <strong>Thymeleaf</strong> provided made it the easy choice for a framework
                          that embodies the same characteristics.

                          We use Thymeleaf for our SAAS service. With <strong>thymeleaf</strong> we can work on our templates both with and without running
                          the service. This way our UI developers can create / maintain the templates while the backend developers make
                          them dynamic.

                        We developed a test management system for a large German bank. It was a small
                        project which concentrated on the things which had the greatest business value. We used <strong>Thymeleaf</strong> in combination
                        with Spring MVC. Despite the fact that many team members weren't  familiar with the technic stack, the project
                        could be realized in time and budget.

                        We discovered <strong>Thymeleaf</strong> at a very early stage and, from the very begining, we loved the tidiness
                        and readability of <strong>Thymeleaf</strong> templates. We were at the time looking for a replacement for JSP
                        in our Java stack and we ended up combining Spring MVC and <strong>Thymeleaf</strong>. Since then we have
                        successfully developed a variety of internet and intranet applications using this combination.
                        <strong>Thymeleaf</strong> has also improved our workflow, making easier the communication between
                        the different profiles involved in our projects.
