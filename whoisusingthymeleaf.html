    <h2>Who is using Thymeleaf?</h2>

    <p>
      Well... we don't really know for sure! :-) Thymeleaf is open source, free, and downloadable without restrictions,
      so there is actually no reason
      why anyone would come and tell us <em>'hey - we're using your software!'</em>... &mdash;
      We actually love it like that because it gives our users total freedom, but the downside is we are
      not able to offer accurate data about the real degree of success the project is enjoying.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, what can we show you here? Two things: first, some <strong>download figures</strong>. And second, some info about those
      <strong>companies or projects using thymeleaf</strong> who have been so kind to take part in this section &mdash;
      thanks to all of them!
    </p>

    <h3>Our figures</h3>

    <p>
      These are our download figures, measured by the Maven Central repository, and only referred to the thymeleaf
      <em>core</em> jar, this is, not including Spring integration, extras, etc. Also, these figures do not include
      distribution (<em>.zip</em> file) downloads from SourceForge.net.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Our users</h3>

    <p>
      <em>Cool people use cool technologies!</em> Below you will be able to see some really interesting names, and
      learn in their own words what brought them to Thymeleaf and how they are currently using it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your company or project is using Thymeleaf in production and you would like to be listed here,
      just have a look at <a href="https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-dist/blob/20130808/WHOS_USING_THYMELEAF_AGREEMENT.markdown">this
      document</a> in order to learn what we would need from you, and <a href="team.html">contact us!</a>

                          &ldquo;<strong>Broadleaf</strong> is an open source, enterprise-ready eCommerce solution developed using the widely
                          adopted Spring Framework. We built our 2.0 demo site in Thymeleaf.

                      <p>
                          After an overwhelmingly positive building experience, picking a templating language for our
                          admin tool when we were replatforming was obvious. We currently leverage Thymeleaf for both
                          our 3.0 demo site and internal admin tool.

                      <p>
                          The flexibility and extension hooks Thymeleaf provided made it the easy choice for a framework

                          We use Thymeleaf for our SAAS service. With Thymeleaf we can work on our templates both with and without running
                          the service. This way our UI developers can create / maintain the templates while the backend developers make

                      <p>
                        We discovered Thymeleaf at a very early stage and, from the very begining, we loved the tidiness
                        and readability of its templates. We were at the time looking for a replacement for JSP
                        in our Java stack and we ended up combining Spring MVC and Thymeleaf.
                      <p>
                      </p>
                        Since then we have successfully developed a variety of internet and intranet applications using
                        this combination. Thymeleaf has also improved our workflow, easing the communication between
                        the different profiles involved in our projects.&rdquo;
