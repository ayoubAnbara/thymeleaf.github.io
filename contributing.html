     <h1>Contributing to Thymeleaf: Terms</h1>

     <p>
       In order to contribute to Thymeleaf, there are some terms with which you must agree:
     </p>

     <h2>Who can contribute?</h2>
  
     <p>
       Anyone, with the unique condition that he/she must be a <b>private individual</b>,
       acting in his/her own name, and not being endorsed in their contributed work
       by any company or government.
     </p>
     <p>
       Note that this condition will not only refer to the ownership of the effort invested in contributing
       to the project, but also to the fact that no private or public company will be mentioned
       as a a part of your contribution on the project's website or code, including but not limited
       to email addresses or package names.
     </p>
     
     <h2>About your contributed code</h2>

     <ul>
       <li>
         First and important: your code <b>must both compile and work correctly</b>. 
         Also, the addition of any new patches to the codebase should not render 
         it unstable in any way.
       </li>
       <li>
         There should be no compilation warnings.
       </li>
       <li>
         All your code should follow the Java Code Conventions. The only 
         exception for this is that column limit is not the usual 
         80 characters (this is a matter of convenience -just don't make them 200 characters
         long and it will be OK).
       </li>
       <li>
         Remember that indentation is made of four spaces, not tabs.
       </li>
       <li>
         All your code should compile and run in Java 1.5, and it should be 
         easy to read and understand by a human.
       </li>
       <li>
         All public methods and classes directly available to the Thymeleaf users
         should have comprehensive javadoc (e.g: functions, operators), and 
         code should have a reasonable amount of comments in it (when needed, 
         of course, not just comment for the sake of comment).
       </li>
       <li>
         All comments, names of classes and variables, log messages, etc. must
        be in <b>English</b>.
       </li>
     </ul>

     <h2>About your relation to the Thymeleaf project</h2>

     <ul>
       <li>
         First and most important: please, don't feel any obligation to do 
         anything. If you like/want/feel happy about contributing, go for it. If not, 
         don't feel any kind of commitment just for having discussed technical 
         details with the project maintainers or other members, just leave it 
         behind and it will be absolutely fine, 
         even if it is after months and you have already coded thousands of lines.
       </li>
       <li>
         You will be <kbd>@author</kbd> for any new classes that you code and also 
         co-author to any existing classes to which you make <i>significant</i> 
         changes. Of course you can say "no" to this, but unless you do, it 
         is a matter of basic fairness to give the credit and merit to the person 
         who deserves it.
       </li>
       <li>
         Your contributions will be applied as patches that you will send to the
         project maintainers, and you will have the consideration of <i>contributor</i> 
         in the team page. This means that you will not have read+write direct access to
         the CVS repository. This is something reserved for developers
         who are author to a very significant percent of the total code base. Of 
         course, this consideration can change in the future.
       </li>
       <li>
         And importantly: You will have to take the required measures, under your 
         entire responsibility, to <b>ensure that neither you nor the company/ies you work for will 
         ever claim any rights over your contributed code</b>, and that all the code 
         you contribute is original and will rise no claims over its intellectual 
         property by any third persons or companies. Also, you agree to contribute 
         your code or documentation <b>completely for free and under the terms established by the 
         Apache License 2.0 in a time-unlimited basis</b>.
       </li>
     </ul>
     


     <h2>Contributing to Thymeleaf: Steps</h2>

     <p>
       If, after carefully reading the above terms, you are willing to contribute 
       some of your effort to Thymeleaf, first of all... THANK YOU!
     </p>
     <p>
       The steps you should take are:
     </p> 

     <ol>
       <li>
         First, send an email to the project maintainers talking about the new features
         or fixes you would like to contribute. Don't forget to include your full
         name :-).
       </li>
       <li>
         If your contribution is approved, send the project maintainers an email
         including a copy of the terms above, with your complete name, and 
         stating clearly that you agree with these conditions.
       </li>
       <li>
         If you work for a company which, by the way or place in which your code was
         written, by your contract terms or by the laws in your contry, could claim
         any rights (including but not limited to intellectual property) over your contributed code, you will have
         to send the project maintainers (either by email from your authorised superiors or 
         by signed fax), a statement indicating that your company agrees
         with the terms explained in this page, and that it both authorises your 
         contribution to Thymeleaf and states that will never claim any kind of rights 
         over it.
       </li>
     </ol>
